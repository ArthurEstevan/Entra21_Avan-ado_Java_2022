# _HashMap_

## _What is a HashMap?_

> A special collection that has usage rules
>
> It is a double list with unique keys and for each key a value
>
> It does not allow duplicates, as it uses key and value, so when there is a duplicate entry, the record will be updated.
>
> When scrolling through the items, it is possible to notice that the order does not obey the insertion or alphabetical criteria.
>
> The order is defined by the collection according to its algorithm's own criteria.
