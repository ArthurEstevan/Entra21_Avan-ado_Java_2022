# _List - ArrayList_

## _What is a ArrayList?_

> To create an object of type ArrayList, we certainly do as usual: using the new operator.
>
> But notice that we ended up passing on a little more information. When declaring the reference to an ArrayList, we pass what type of object it will work with.
>
> If we want a list of class names, let's declare ArrayList<String>.
>
>> ArrayList<String.> classes = new ArrayList<>();
>
>
> Unlike vectors and matrices, collections are potentially infinite because their size can increase or decrease as needed and that's why the size attribute is now accessed through the size() method to make this difference clearer.
