# _What is Advanced Java?_

> Java is an object-oriented programming language developed in the 1990s by a team of programmers led by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. In 2008, Java was acquired by Oracle Corporation.
>
> Java's main function is to build network applications, such as games and programs. In other words, a Java programmer can design software that can be operated and distributed on multiple platforms, such as mac, windows and linux without having to modify them and even without thinking about the architecture of the machine.
